# I consider myself to be:

- a human being who lives in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada
- professionally experienced programmer, designer, administrator (6+ years)
- self taught in theoretical and applied sciences, chiefly computers and technology
- a passionate advocate for design based on human factors

# My heart resonates with glee while:

- architecting and designing interactive systems for human beings
- being a perfectionist who gets good results under challenging constraints
- sharing the joy of programming with curious humans
- learning something new from a podcast or web article

# My stomach twinges in the presence of:

- typeface abuse, white space neglect, and overworked cliches
- unfriendly websites and apps for otherwise exemplary companies
- most of my past work, after about six months

# I will gladly converse with you, ad nauseam about:

- critical thinking, logical fallacies, and the human mind
- composing, curating, analyzing and experiencing music
- Linux, open source software, command line tools, servers, and "the cloud"
- anything you find fascinating, if you can convey your point of view

# My usernames:

I'm usually just `devvyn`, though sometimes I'm stuck with
`devvynpm` or `devvynmurphy`. (I'm never `dewyn`.)
