## Raw source

The raw [source] for this site's content
is in a plain text format called [Markdown].
While in this raw form
the files are easy for humans to edit
but web browsers can't display them well.
The browser-friendly version of that content
is generated by a program called [Jekyll],
then sent directly to the web host.

You can view or comment on the source for this site
at the [project page][source].

## Continuous delivery via GitHub Pages

Each time the source code changes,
GitHub signals a service called [GitHub Pages],
which rebuilds the browser-friendly site
by passing the raw source to [Jekyll]
before storing the results to the web host.

## Web hosting by GitHub Pages

Besides being a service where [Jekyll]
processes Markdown into websites,
[GitHub Pages] also hosts sites,
free of charge, and free of advertising.

There is no server system that users must maintain
because GitHub Pages is limited to serving
content generated by Jekyll from GitHub repositories,
and the rest of the details are the burden of GitHub.

## You are here

GitHub lets each user
publish their site to a subdomain
based on the user's name,
such as [devvyn.github.io].
GitHub Pages also allows
a custom domain name to replace it.
For the sake of memorability,
this site uses [devvyn.io].
