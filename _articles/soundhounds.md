# How would you describe SoundHounds?

A digital thing that, as a mobile app, algorithmically performs the following transformation:
User-supplied audio + metadata + parameterized configuration => copyright-free, sample based, parametric music composition

There's more to it than that, though: there's a documentary film, and the social networking aspect shouldn't be overlooked as both a crucial component to unlocking the full power of SoundHounds as well as an enricher of the user experience.

The proper answer, if one can step back, is that SoundHounds is a redefinition of music and song as we know it.

# What are thoughts from a programmer's point of view?

The formula mentioned in opening fits well with the functional programming paradigm because, output may--given certain possible configurations--be intrinsically dynamic and extremely--though finitely--unpredictable. 

Caveat: Acceptance of this fact requires accepting a redefinition of user shareable, digital music content files, because any significant unpredictability of the resulting playback of the shared file subsequent to transferral (or otherwise, for that matter) would violate the concept of recorded music, while conversely all the consequential properties of live musical performance--especially improvisational aspects--would violate the concept of programmatically computed music files.

# What is SoundHounds from a programmer's point of view?

Given that songs produced with SoundHounds exist in the domain between either of the two conceptual extremes, and therefore also in both, as a hybridization of human performance and mathematical record sharing, SoundHounds songs are uniquely special end especially unique.
