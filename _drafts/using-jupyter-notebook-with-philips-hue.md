### Jupyter Notebook is one of my favourite tools for exploration and experimentation.

A while ago I dove into the wonderful world of Jupyter Notebook, and let me tell you, it was an eye-opening delight.
To give it a test drive, I played with the Philips hue API using standard Python inside a Jupyter Notebook session.
I alternated between writing a Markdown-formatted explanation of what I was about to do, followed by the actual Python code and the resulting output.

You can see what my Jupyter notebook looks like at [NBViewer], which shows a nicely formatted version of the notebook file stored as a public [GitHub Gist].
